# SalesPrediction

Preprocessed the data by handling missing values and performed standardization for better model performance.

Implemented a neural network model using the Keras API with two hidden layers (64 and 32 units) and a linear output layer.

Evaluated the model's performance using mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared metrics.

Visualized the training history to analyze the model's performance using matplotlib.

Demonstrated proficiency in data preprocessing, neural network modeling, model evaluation, and visualization techniques.
